### **Dataset Information:**
This data contains information about a group of test subjects and their sleep patterns. Each subject was identified with a unique “Subject ID”, noting age and gender. Bedtime, wake-up time, and sleep duration were recorded, while sleep efficiency measured the proportion of time in bed compared to time asleep. The percentage of REM, deep, and light sleep reflects the distribution of sleep time in certain stages. Awakenings recorded the number of times the subject woke up during the night. Data also includes caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking status, and frequency of exercise in the 24 hours before bed.

### **Background:**
Nowadays, optimizing employee performance has become a paramount goal for forward-thinking companies. Recognizing the profound impact of sleep on productivity, our organization is embarking on a mission to enhance the well-being and efficiency of our workforce. Through a meticulous analysis of sleep efficiency, we aim to uncover actionable insights that will empower our employees to achieve their full potential, fostering a workplace where restful nights translate into heightened professional performance.

### **Objective:**
In this project, our goal is to prepare data with automated cleaning so that we can then analyze sleep efficiency and explore the factors that influence it.
